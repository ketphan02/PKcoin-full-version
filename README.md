# PKcoin

An implementation of blockchain using python

## Work
### Frontend
React js
### Backend
Python (the implemented code) and flask

### Reference
My two repositories:
* [Dummy Blockchain](https://github.com/ketphan02/PKcoin)
* [PKcoin-frontend](https://github.com/ketphan02/pkcoin-frontend)<br>
I did lots of work to connect these two repositories, but still, these two are the core of this project.
